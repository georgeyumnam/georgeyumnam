### Why TMDs?
Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess promising electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric properties.

### What structure do they have?
TMDs have quasi two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with transition metal atoms sandwiched between corresponding chalcogen sub-layers. These layers are bonded by van der Waals (vdW) interaction.
