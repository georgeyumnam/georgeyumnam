### Why TMDs?
Due to their promising electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric properties.

### What structure do they have?
TMDs have quasi two-dimensional (2D) layered structure with transition metal atoms sandwiched between corresponding chalcogen sub-layers. These layers are bonded by van der Waals (vdW) interaction.

### Why study TMDs?
Ability to form 2D structures with relative ease in fabrication and characterization, hence making it very favourable for thin film device applications.

### The ones I am after:
Many researchers had reported various studies on Group - VI TMDs (Mo and W based), however I have found that Group - IV TMDs (Zr and Hf based) are very favorable for high temperature thermoelectric applications.
