						<p>Bigfoot, is also known as sasquatch, is the name given to an ape-like creature that some people believe inhabits forests. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. The term sasquatch is an anglecized derivative of the Halkomelem word sasq'ets.</p>

						<p>Most scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather that a living animal, because of the lack of physical evidence the large number of creatures that would be necessary to maintain a breeding population. A few scientists, such as Jane Goodall, Grover Krants, and Jeffrey Meldrum, have expressed interest and some measure of belief in the creature.</p>

						<p>Bigfoot is described in reports as a large hairy ape-like creature, in a range of 6-10 feet (2-3m) tall, weighing in excess of 500 pounds (230 kg), and covered in dark brown or dark reddish hair. Purported witnesses have described large eyes, a probounced brown ridge, and a large, low-set forehead; the top of the head has been described as rounded crested, similar to the sagittal crest of the male gorilla. Bigfoot is commonly reported to have a strong, unpleasant smell but those who claim to have encountered it. The enormous footprints for which it is named have been as large as 24 inches (60cm) long and 8 inches (20cm) wide. While most casts have 5 toes -  like all known apes - some casts of alleged Bigfoot tracks have had numbers ranging from two to six. Some have also contained claw marks, making it likely that a portion came from known animals such as bears, which have five toes and claws. Proponents claim that Bigfoot is omnivorous and mainly nocturnal.</p>

						<p>Wildmen stories are found among the indigenous population of the Pacific Northwest. The legends existed prior to a single name for the creature. They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar stories of wildmen are found on every continent except Antarctica. Ecologist Robert Michael Pyle argues that most cultures have human-like giants in their folk history: "We have this need for some larger-than-life creature." Members fo the Lummi tell tales about Ts'emekwes, the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in terms of the general descriptions of Ts'emekews, but details about the creature's diet and activities differed between the stories of different families.</p>

						<p>Some regional versions contained more nefarious creatures. The stiyaha or kwi-kwiyai were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a persom - sometimes to be killed. In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the native people about skoocooms: a race of cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of Mount St. Helens. The skoocooms apprear to have been regarded as supernatural, rather than natural. Less menacing versions such as the one recorded by Reverend Elkanah Walker exist. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living in Spokane, Washington. The indians claimed that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole salmon from the fishermen's nets.</p>
